# Atomic Components in Next.js (Hybrid)

Pure atomic design is often too rigid for product work. Hybrid atomic keeps a clean design system while preserving feature ownership.

## When to load

- Defining component taxonomy (atom/molecule/organism/template).
- Deciding shared vs feature-local component placement.
- Reviewing component reuse and abstraction quality.

## When NOT to load

- Task is route/layout boundaries (`app-router-and-rsc-boundaries.md`).
- Task is cache/revalidation behavior (`data-fetching-cache-and-revalidation.md`).
- Task is mutation flow (`server-actions-and-mutations.md`).

## Core rules

- Shared primitives (`components/ui`) are stable and domain-neutral.
- Composites default to feature-local unless reused by 2+ features.
- Route-level templates belong in `app/*`.
- Keep domain terms in feature-local component names.

## Common patterns

- `Button`, `Input`, `Dialog` in shared `components/ui`.
- `InvoiceStatusPill`, `ProjectMemberRow` in feature folders.
- Promote to shared only when API can stay domain-neutral.

## Minimal examples

Shared primitive (domain-neutral):

```tsx
// components/ui/badge.tsx
export function Badge({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <span className="inline-flex rounded px-2 py-0.5 text-sm">{children}</span>
  );
}
```

Feature-local component (domain-specific):

```tsx
// features/invoices/components/invoice-status-pill.tsx
import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge";

export function InvoiceStatusPill({ status }: { status: "paid" | "overdue" }) {
  return <Badge>{status === "paid" ? "Paid" : "Overdue"}</Badge>;
}
```

## Anti-patterns

- Moving domain-specific components into shared `ui` too early.
- Creating deep global atomic hierarchies no feature owns.
- Reusable component names that leak product-specific assumptions.

## Checklist

- Is this component domain-neutral and reused enough to be shared?
- If not, is it kept under `features/<feature>/components`?
- Does naming communicate ownership and intent?
