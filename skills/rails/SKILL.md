# Rails Skills Index

Routing index for Rails 7.x/8.x work, optimized for thin models/controllers and PORO architecture.

## Core architecture policy

- Controllers orchestrate request/response, not business rules.
- Models keep data invariants, not multi-step workflows.
- Complex behavior belongs in POROs: services, queries, form objects, policies, value objects.
- Concerns are for cohesive shared behavior, not cross-domain dumping grounds.

## Quick routing

| Task                                    | Load                            | Why                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Decide where logic should live          | `thin-mvc-architecture.md`      | Placement decision matrix             |
| Share model behavior safely             | `model-concerns.md`             | Concern boundaries and anti-patterns  |
| Keep controllers thin and composable    | `controller-concerns.md`        | Controller concerns and orchestration |
| Implement domain workflows or filtering | `service-and-query-objects.md`  | PORO patterns with contracts          |
| API docs and internal commenting style  | `documentation-and-comments.md` | Rails-specific docs/comment standards |
| Write/structure tests                   | `../testing/ruby-rails.md`      | TDD + Rails test pyramid              |

## Where should this logic go?

| Use case                                         | Place it in        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Validation/data invariant                        | Model              |
| Multi-step write workflow                        | Service object     |
| Reusable query/filter/sort                       | Query object       |
| Shared model behavior within one bounded context | Model concern      |
| Shared controller plumbing (auth, pagination)    | Controller concern |
| Authorization                                    | Policy object      |
| Domain primitive (money, email, range)           | Value object       |
