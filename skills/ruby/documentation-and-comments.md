# Ruby Documentation and Comments

## When to load

- You are documenting Ruby public APIs and non-obvious behavior.
- You need comment guidance that stays concise and useful.

## When NOT to load

- You are primarily picking test strategy.
- You are working on architecture decisions unrelated to docs.

## Core rules

- Use YARD for public methods/classes/modules.
- Explain why and constraints before implementation details.
- Keep comments for intent, invariants, and caveats.
- Delete stale comments when behavior changes.

## Patterns

- YARD tags: `@param`, `@return`, `@raise`, `@example`.
- One short rationale line before complex logic.
- Document side effects (DB writes, network calls, retries).
- Route doc style decisions through `../documentation/SKILL.md`.

## Anti-patterns

- Restating obvious code in comments.
- Missing error/side-effect docs on public APIs.
- Large narrative comments that drift from implementation.

## Checklist

- Public API has YARD docs with inputs/outputs/errors.
- Non-obvious decisions include concise rationale.
- Comments match current behavior after edits.
